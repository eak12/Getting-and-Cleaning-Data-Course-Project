# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

step one - open RStudio

step two - open run_analysis.R 

step three - in RStudio open session > set working directory > choose directory > choose: desktop

step three - steps explained in run_analysis which produces the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The result is the tidy data set (the csv files attached/pulled to this repository).

The tidy set of data consists of eight csv files.  The raw data has been split into measurements types.  Each csv file is a type of measurement.

The allMeanMeasures.txt is the merged data of the eight csv files.
